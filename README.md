The Odin Project's course for developing basic Html and CSS skills by creating a mimic of Google's homepage. It is in its basic form and not about serious programming.


From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

Inspired in part by: Typhoon, a member of the Odin project. Thanks.
